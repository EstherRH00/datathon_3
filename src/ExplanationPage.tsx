      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        First of all we dove deep into the data and, using mainly pandas,
        explored the dataset; we were looking to answer the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>How can we give a broad description of the data?</li>
        <li>Did COVID affect the data? If so, how?</li>
        <li>Are there any periodic events?</li>
        <li>What is the shelf life of each product?</li>
        <li>Are any products co-related?</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-3xl py-2.5">Data exploration</h1>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        First of all; lets list the most relevant columns of the dataset
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">CODIGO:</span> Code for the product. The
          first letter marks the category.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">FECHAPEDIDO:</span> Day when the order was
          placed
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">CANTIDADCOMPRA:</span> Amount bought
          (number of packages)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">UNIDADESCONSUMOCONTENIDAS:</span> Amount
          in each unit (amount of product in each package)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">ORIGEN:</span> Where the order was placed
          as Region_ID - Hospital_ID - Department_ID
        </li>
        <li>TODO</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        During the data exploration, we found some interesting properties that
        we want to highlight:
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          Each product can be uniquely identified by their code (
          <span className="font-bold">CODIGO</span>) and the amount of items per
          package (<span className="font-bold">UNIDADESCONSUMOCONTENIDAS</span>)
        </li>
        <li>
          There are 20 hospitals in the first region (0) and one hospital in the
          region 1. The difference in the amount of hospitals in each region
          made us decide not to take regions into account and only consider
          hospitals.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are 4 possible categories in which products fall, according to
          the first digit of their CODE: B, C, D and E. We might be able to use
          those to find some correlation between the products in one category.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        And with this insight we decided to add the following columns:
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>month: extracted from FECHAPEDIDO.</li>
        <li>year: extracted from FECHAPEDIDO.</li>
        <li>
          id_hospital: extracted from ORIGEN; we maintained the id for the
          hospitals in the Region 0 and gave the id '20' to the hospital in the
          Region 1.
        </li>
        <li>id_department: extracted from ORIGEN.</li>
        <li>
          total_units: computed as the product of CANTIDADCOMPRA and
          UNIDADESCONSUMOCONTENIDAS.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="pt-2 text-2xl">Correlation</p>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        We will study the correlation in between the products of each category
        and between categories; and with that information decide if we
        investigate more.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-2 text-lg">Between products in the same category:</p>

      </div>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        Seeing the high correlation between the products in category B and F,
        and since category B has only 2 products, we decide to compute the
        correlation between all the products in categories B and F
      </p>

        Lastly, we compute the correlation between all the products and extract
        the ones that score more than 0.75; obtaining the following:

      <p className="pt-2 text-2xl">Seasonality</p>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        We will try to find seasonal items; in order to do that, we add, by
        month, the total amount of the product bought; as a sum between all
        hospitals. With this, we also expect to see if COVID did have some
        effect in the tendencies of product shopping.
        <br />
        We have plotted all the products and compared them, but we have not
        found any periodical pattern, nor have we found the years 2020 and 2021
        to be outliers.
        <br />
        Below these lines we show one plot that exemplifies what we have just
        described, and all of the plots can be found in the notebook.

      <p className="pt-2 text-2xl">Expiration date approximation</p>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        After checking possible relations between data, we decided to compute
        how much time it takes one product to expire. Knowing that buying in
        bulk is cheaper than one command at a time, we followed the following
        path to determine the expiration time of each product.
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          The first idea was to search the Internet for expiration dates for
          each product. There are only 48 different products, so the task should
          not be too tedious. However, there is not a unified convention name
          for each product, so the results obtained varied depending on the web
          page. Knowing that, this option was not feasible, so we decided to
          obtain this information only with the data in the dataset provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          To obtain the expiration time for each product, we first computed the
          average expiration date with the following formula in pandas:
        </li>
        <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
          <li>
            Sort the rows by tuples (CODIGO, FECHAPEDIDO) and compute the
            difference in days between each order of the same CODIGO. This value
            is stored in the dataset as DaysBetweenOrders.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Compute the mean of the days passed between each order of the same
            CODIGO. This value is called CaducidadAllHospitals.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2">
        <CorrCard
          image={require("./images/average_hospital.PNG")}
          text={"Expiracy time in days of each product for each hospital"}
        />
      </div>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        However, we saw that the expiracy date was determined by the department
        that orders the product, not the hospital itself. So we did the same
        steps, but this time sorting the rows by the triplets ['id_hospital',
        'id_department', 'CODIGO', 'FECHAPEDIDOâ€™]. This way, we estimated the
        average time it takes for each department to order again a product.
        Example of data obtained:

      <div>
        <ul className="list-none">
          <li>
            Average days per Order per Hospital per Department for the product
            E64761 in the (id_hospital id_department) = (0, 0) is 36.708333 days

      <h1 className="text-3xl py-2.5">Model training and prediction</h1>
      <h1 className="text-3xl py-2.5">SARIMAX</h1>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        After thorough exploration of the data and preparing the dataset with
        information obtained from pre-processing, we opted to employ a
        statistical model designed for predicting time series data, known as
        SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with
        eXogenous regressors).
      </p>

      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        This model comprises three main components:
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          The autoregressive element, which establishes a relationship between
          current values and past values (lags).
        </li>
        <li>
          The moving average element, assuming that the prediction error is a
          linear combination of past predicted errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          The integrated component, indicating that the original values of the
          series have been replaced by the differences between consecutive
          values (this differencing process can be executed multiple times).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        Additionally, SARIMAX models incorporate seasonal patterns and exogenous
        variables, aligning well with our forecasting objectives. For instance,
        products related to winter diseases may experience peak demand during
        the winter season.
      </p>

      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        In our SARIMA model, we followed this approach:
      </p>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          endog: The observed time-series process y. We computed a moving
          average and sliding window for each timestep.
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of timesteps: We used the minimum value of the expiry column
          for each product.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1 className="text-3xl py-2.5">How to compute the endog?</h1>
      <p className="pt-2 text-ml">
        To calculate the moving average, we implemented the "Tales algorithm,"
        which involves summing up all the data points during a specific period
        and dividing the sum by the number of time periods. In cases where there
        are two orders in the same sliding window,
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-3xl py-2.5">Input for the SARIMAX model:</h1>
      <ul className="pt-2 pl-4 list-disc marker:text-green-600">
        <li>
          A matrix of size 48xn, with: Rows representing the 48 different
          products. Columns representing the amounts ordered for each product.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exogenous variables: price, tgl, and tipocompra. Although not directly
          involved in the prediction, these variables can be used to determine
          moments when the product is more affordable, for instance.
